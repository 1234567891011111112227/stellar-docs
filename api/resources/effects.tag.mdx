Effects represent specific changes that occur in the ledger as a result of successful operations, but are not necessarily directly reflected in the ledger or history, as transactions and operations are.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
