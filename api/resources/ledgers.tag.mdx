Each ledger stores the state of the network at a point in time and contains all the changes - transactions, operations, effects, etc. - to that state.



```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
