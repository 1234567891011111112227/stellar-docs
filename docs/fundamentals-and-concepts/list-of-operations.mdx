Operations are objects that represent a desired change to the ledger and are submitted to the network grouped in a transaction. For each operation, there is a successful or failed result type. In the case of success, the user can gather information about the effect of the operation. In the case of failure, the user can learn more about the error.

Learn more about transactions and operations in our [Transaction and Operations section](#).
